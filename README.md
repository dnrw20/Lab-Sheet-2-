Lab Sheet Exercises
#Exercise 1:
Write a function(s) that prints out the reverse of a string (do
not use a C standard library function to handle the reversal). Call this
function from main() to test your program.\n
#Exercise 2:
Write a function(s) that converts an octal number, represented
as a string (char array), into its decimal value (do not use a C standard
library function to handle the conversion). Call this function from main()
to test your program.
#Exercise 4:
Write a function(s) which given a string (char array) returns
true if the string is a palindrome and false if it is not. A palindrome is a
word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards (e.g.
“rotor”; “101”). Call this function from main() to test your program.
#Exercise 5: 
Write a function(s) to implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes. This
algorithm is used to find all the prime numbers less than or equal to a given
integer n.
You should write 2 functions. One function should implement the Sieve
of Eratosthenes algorithm using an array stored as a global variable. The
second function should print whether the given integer is prime or not prime
by using the generated array from the first function - this function should
only accept integers between 0 and 100 (inclusive).
Finally, you should demonstrate your program by calling your functions
from main().
